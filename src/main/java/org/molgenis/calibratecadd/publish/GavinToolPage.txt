<h1>Please upload your variant file</h1>

<p>
	Two types of file are accepted:
	<ol>
		<li>

		<b>A <a href="http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/specs.html">VCF file</a> file (GRCh37/hg19), or comparable tab delimited file</b> with columns CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT.
		Your file may contain up to 100,000 variants. This web service follows the input rules of the <a href="http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/score">CADD service</a>, meaning that it is sufficient to provide the first 5 columns as tab-separated values of a (gzipped) VCF file. All other information than CHROM, POS, REF, ALT will be ignored, as is the header (ie. any line starting with #). Files may be up to 3MB, and up to 100,000 variants can be processed per submission. Use file extension vcf, tsv, txt or tab (gzipped: vcf.gz, tsv.gz, txt.gz, tab.gz) with UTF-8/ASCII encoding.
		Examples: <a href="http://www.molgenis.org/downloads/gavin/variantclassificationwebtool/testfiles/gavin_simpleexamplefile_fivecol.vcf">minimal TSV file with 5 columns, no header</a>, or a <a href="http://www.molgenis.org/downloads/gavin/variantclassificationwebtool/testfiles/gavin_simpleexamplefile_truevcf.vcf">regular VCF file with many columns and header</a>.

		</li>
		<li>

		<b>A <a href="http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/score">CADD service</a> output file for indel classification</b>. This allows you to pre-score any variant including insertions/deletions, which GAVIN cannot do for you (it does accept any SNV using static CADD resources). This format is detected as: CHROM POS REF ALT RawScore PHRED, as tab-separated values, the last two being decimals, any headers (#..) are ignored. Example: <a href="http://www.molgenis.org/downloads/gavin/variantclassificationwebtool/testfiles/gavin_simpleexamplefile_fromcadd.tsv">CADD-output file with 6 columns and header</a>.

		</li>
	</ol>

Your results will be available under an random URL that others cannot reach without knowing. Result files are deleted after 24 hours and will not be accessed by the MOLGENIS team.
