analysis work flow steps in a nutshell:
1) get clinvar pathogenic variants, curate, write to a vcf file (e.g. 'clinvarpatho.vcf')
2) fix indel notation where possible by merging with "ClinVar VCF edition"
3) run snpeff on this file
4) load clinvar-snpeff vcf and from ExAC, get similar variants from the same genes
5) run variant output file though CADD web service
6) combine CADD output back with original variant file
7) compute basic results as a calibration table per gene
8) perform benchmark on GAVIN using calibration table, also run other tools
9) run R script functions to perform derived statistics and visualizations
